Hello every one. I'm Amir and this is my first experience using Github and ofcourse, it's my first created repository.
In this repository I share my recent codes which I wrote them for practicing and learning. I forgot to mention that these are Python codes. 
It would be a great pleasure, If you check up my codes and give me some feedback. I would appreciate it.
Well, that's it. Good luck and have a nice day! :)
